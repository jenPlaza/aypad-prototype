It was created by 7 young men who had seen harsh realities being experienced on the entire continent as a result of war and the consequent violence galore which follow. Therefore, they decided to form the organization with the vision of continental integration for peace and development for youths in the continent. <br /><br />AYPAD believes in establishing opportunities for young people in Africa through our multifaceted development programs that enables peace, sustainable development, and social integration. Our goal as a non-profit charity is to create opportunities, enable and empower particularly disadvantaged young people, and the marginalized whose lives are constantly under threat because of their deprived economic and social situation. <br /><br />Our organization relies solely on charitable funding and donations to ensure the survival, sustainability, and success of our projects in order to benefit the most vulnerable young people in Africa and to ensure they have a future. It has hold membership of different networks and is also affiliated to many organization such as GYAN, GYCA, Peace Child, War child Canada, WayOut International and, IFFDO. Actually, AYPAD has been registered with the governments in 29 countries across the African continent with the belief that violence achieves no meaningful goal and not a solution. </p><br /><br /><a href="./assets/pdf/aypad_profile-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" >Africa Youth for Peace and Development - Profile (pdf)</a ><br /><br /></section></main><div class="divider"></div><section id="projects_gallery"></section><div><section id="upcoming_events"><h3>Upcoming Events</h3><section id="events"></section></section><section id="partners_gallery"><h3>Partners & Affiliations</h3><ul id="logos" class="rotate"></ul></section></div><div class="divider"></div><section id="donate"><h2>Together we can make it happen<br />Donate <em>Today</em></h2></section><section id="signUp"><div><div><h3>Lets do it together</h3><h3><b>Join Us In Pushing Africa Forward</b></h3></div><br /><iframe src="subscribe.html?embedded=true" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" >Loading…</iframe ></div></section><footer><section id="location"></section><section id="map"></section><section id="socialM"></section></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="./js/edit.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="./js/aypad/aypadEdit.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="./js/main.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="./js/aypad/aypadFunctions.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="./js/replace.js"></script></body></html>
