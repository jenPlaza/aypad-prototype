        <h2>Africa Youth for Peace and Development</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Africa Youth for Peace and Development (AYPAD) was established on 24
          October 1995 in Sierra Leone and registered as a non-profit charity
          with the Government of Sierra Leone in 2000, holding a United Nations
          Economic and Social accredited Status. It was created by 7 young men
          who had seen harsh realities being experienced on the entire continent
          as a result of war and the consequent violence galore which follow.
          Therefore, they decided to form the organization with the vision of
          continental integration for peace and development for youths in the
          continent.
          <br /><br />
          AYPAD believes in establishing opportunities for young people in
          Africa through our multifaceted development programs that enables
          peace, sustainable development, and social integration. Our goal as a
          non-profit charity is to create opportunities, enable and empower
          particularly disadvantaged young people, and the marginalized whose
          lives are constantly under threat because of their deprived economic
          and social situation.
          <br /><br />
          Our organization relies solely on charitable funding and donations to
          ensure the survival, sustainability, and success of our projects in
          order to benefit the most vulnerable young people in Africa and to
          ensure they have a future. It has hold membership of different
          networks and is also affiliated to many organization such as GYAN,
          GYCA, Peace Child, War child Canada, WayOut International and, IFFDO.
          Actually, AYPAD has been registered with the governments in 29
          countries across the African continent with the belief that violence
          achieves no meaningful goal and not a solution.
